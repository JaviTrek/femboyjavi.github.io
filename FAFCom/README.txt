So I'm currently using Pug as basic HTML, not using any of its special features (I just think it looks much cleaner to type .class than <div> class =

Using SASS as just CSS (no real reason, was told to learn SASS so I just started typing my css into it)

And regular javascript is inside the HTML folder
